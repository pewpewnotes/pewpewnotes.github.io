### Intro 11
Okay, I accept it, I am a fucking idiot, A BIG FUCKING IDIOT

The thing that we had to notice was the url, the url was getting redirected and we were reading
source code of incorrect site. 

Correct Site: https://defendtheweb.net/playground/intro11
Incorrect Site: https://defendtheweb.net/playground/intro11?input
To get to correct site I was feeling lazy so I simulated a slow 3g connection and stopped it as soon as intro11 loaded Not giving it time to redirect itself.
