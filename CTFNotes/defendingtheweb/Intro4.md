### Intro 1
Simply search for username and password in the HTML code of the form.
But this time you will not find it as a comment or colored code, instead its inside the tag as a json file path
Take the path and append it to the actual one and you will be automatically send to a file containing it

### Creds
```
Path: https://defendtheweb.net/extras/playground/9d2K4Fw.json
{
    "username": "thomas",
    "password": "S9234HKFnsd"
}
```

### Tip
* Always use sources panel to observe the source code, as its easy to miss out on comments inside inspect element
* Make sure to use the New tab and current site, because its possible to disallow redirection to file from any other place in site.
