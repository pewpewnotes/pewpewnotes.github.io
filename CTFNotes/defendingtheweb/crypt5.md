### Crypt 4

We are greeted with another text that seems like caesar cipher, but guessing its not I put it in frquency analyzer. And with another guess, I looked at colon, since its supposed to be preceeded by pass, I knew what p,a,s were. And it seemed reverse, I reversed it again and then put it in analyzer.
Note: Use this for frequency analysis [Frequency Analysis](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~awilson/tools/frequency_analysis.html)
Rest will be easy :P
