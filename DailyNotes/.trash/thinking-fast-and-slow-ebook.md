So we have been reading a lot of things in thinking fast and slow, The idea here in is to have a system wherein we are going to take and keep a backup of our notes and keep it synchronized, and whatever we read+highlight stays in here, and this becomes our second mind.

1. Not sure what my thought process was when I highlighted this. Must have been testing

understanding of the mechanism of association was an improvement in a method of measurement. Until a few decades ago, the only way to study associations was to ask many people questions such as, “What is the first word that comes to your mind when you hear the word DAY?” The researchers tallied the frequency of responses, such as “night,” “sunny,” or “long.” In the 1980s, psychologists discovered that exposure to a word causes immediate and measurable changes in the ease with which many related

2. This was about being engaged, its basically utilizing the system 2 of our head which allows slow and deliberate thinking. System 2 is more important because it allows us to deliberately come up with an answer. What is important here is that, its not like system 1 is useless (you don't want to slow think walking afterall)

Those who avoid the sin of intellectual sloth could be called “engaged.” They are more alert, more intellectually active, less willing to be satisfied with superficially attractive answers, more skeptical about their intuitions. The psychologist Keith Stanovich would call them more rational.

3. Bat and ball puzzle is interesting, very interesting. This is the note about it
```
Many thousands of university students have answered the bat-and-ball puzzle, and the results are shocking. More than 50% of students at Harvard, MIT, and Princeton ton gave the intuitive—incorrect—answer. At less selective universities, the rate of demonstrable failure to check was in excess of 80%. The bat-and-ball problem is our first encounter with an observation that will be a recurrent theme of this book: many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuitions. They apparently find cognitive effort at least mildly unpleasant and avoid it as much as possible

So context: if a bat costs a dollar more than ball and bat and ball costs 1.10 then what would be the cost of bat? Ideally if you don't think carefully and jump with fast answer, it will sound valid to have the answer as 10 cents. But think more :P, if the bat costed a dollar more, then bat alone would cost 1.10! and the total should be 1.20, which is incorrect. The cost should be matematically calculated, let's say bat costs bat amount and ball costs ball amount then we know,
```
bat + ball = 1.10
bat - ball = 1.00

2 * bat = 2.10 => bat = 1.05
```


hehe!

4. This is something more like `willpower juices` meaning, how much we can push ourselves.
```
A disturbing demonstration of depletion effects in judgment was recently reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The unwitting participants in the study were eight parole judges in Israel. They spend entire days reviewing applications for parole. The cases are presented in random order, and the judges spend little time on each one, an average of 6 minutes. (The default decision is denial of parole; 
only 35% of requests are approved. The exact time of each decision is recorded, and the times of the judges’ three food breaks—morning break, lunch, and afternoon break—during the day are recorded as well.) The authors of the study plotted the proportion of approved requests against the time since the last food break. The proportion spikes after each meal, when about 65% of requests are granted. During the two hours or so until the judges’ next feeding, the approval rate drops steadily, to about zero just before the meal. As you might expect, this is an unwelcome result and the authors carefully checked many alternative explanations. The best possible account of the data provides bad news: tired and hungry judges tend to fall back on the easier default position of denying requests for parole. Both fatigue and hunger probably play a role

5. Here is how we can retrieve the mental juices faster!
```
most surprising discovery made by Baumeister’s group shows, as he puts it, that the idea of mental energy is more than a mere metaphor. The nervous system consumes more glucose than most other parts of the body, and effortful mental activity appears to be especially expensive in the currency of glucose. When you are actively involved in difficult cognitive reasoning or engaged in a task that requires self-control, your blood glucose level drops. The effect is analogous to a runner who draws down glucose stored in her muscles during a sprint. The bold implication of this idea is that the effects of ego depletion could be undone by ingesting glucose, and Baumeister and his colleagues have confirmed this hypothesis n ohypothesiin several experiments

6. This is more about conginitive illusions, we need to study about it more. #read
```
Not all illusions are visual. There are illusions of thought, which we call cognitive illusions. As a graduate student, I attended some courses on the art and science of psychotherapy. During one of these lectures, our teacher imparted a morsel of clinical wisdom. This is what he told us: “You will from time to time meet a patient who shares a disturbing tale of multiple mistakes in his previous treatment. He has been seen by several clinicians, and all failed him. The patient can lucidly describe how his therapists misunderstood him, but he has quickly perceived that you are different. You share the same feeling, are convinced that you understand him, and will be able to help.” At this point my teacher raised his voice as he said, “Do not even think of taking on this patient! Throw him out of the office! He is most likely a psychopath and you will not be able to help him.”
Many years later I learned that the teacher had warned us against psychopathic charm, and the leading authority in the study of psychopathy confirmed that the teacher’s advice was sound. The analogy to the Müller-Lyer illusion is close. What we were being taught was not how to feel about that patient. Our teacher took it for granted that the sympathy we would feel for the patient would not be under our control; it would arise from System 1. Furthermore, we were not being taught to be generally suspicious of our feelings about patients.

7. This is about the gorilla game, where in they had created the basketball game and the people who were caught in the experiment were asked to count the number of passes, and since people were so focussed on the balls they didnt realize that a gorilla came in between the game
```
The most dramatic demonstration was offered by Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons in their book The Invisible Gorilla. They constructed a short film of two teams passing basketballs, one team wearing white shirts, the other wearing black. The viewers of the film are instructed to count the number of passes made by the white team, ignoring the black players.

8. This is about `intuitive heuristics` => it basically means a shortcut that system one uses to come to an answer, super quick. This answer is not correct, need not be correct in case of lack of expertise.
