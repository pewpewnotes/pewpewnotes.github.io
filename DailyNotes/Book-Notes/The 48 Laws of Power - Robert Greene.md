- No days unalert and calculate every pitfall that might emerge
- L9ook at the past but not to hurt yourself but to learn from those who came before you.

- As Nietzsche says, The value of thing is not decided by what we attain from it but what it costs us. 
- As baltasrr gracian says, Many people out there invest their tuime and energy in learning about plants and animals, only if that time was used to learn humans with whom we live or die.

* He was a generous man, who loved lavish parties and money, but then when Louis XIV ‘s prime minister died, he thought he will get the position but the king decided to rid of the position itself which made him think that he is losing favour of the king and so as to ingratiate himself to the position, he staged one of the most spectacular parties.
* La fontaine, La rouchefoucauld, Madame de sevigne, attended the parties, and it had a full blow 7 meal course with oriental food which was never seen in france before and along with that it had special meal prepared for party itself. 
* Along with all that, the chateau had spectacular gardens and he himself accompanied the young king to the tour and many other fun things.
* The next day Fouquet was arrested by the king on the charges of stealing the money from treasury which in truth he had done with the permission of king for the king himself. And three months later was sent to most isolated prison of france.
