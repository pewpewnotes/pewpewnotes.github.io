#### Laying Plans
***
- Five factors govern the War:
	1. *The moral Law:* People are in complete accordance to their ruler, it makes them follow their kings all the time.
	2. *The heavens:* It signifies the night and day, heat and cold and the seasons
	3. *Earth:* It comprises the distance, great and small, danger and security, Open ground and Narrow passe
	4. *Commander:* The commander stands for virtues, of sincerity, benevolence, courage, strictness and wisdom
	5. *Method and Discipline:*  This decides how the army is in control and how it behaves, a well disciplined army works in unison and proceeds to victory.
- According as circumstances are favourable one should alter the plans.
- All warfare is based on deception.
- Hence, when able to attack appear unable to, when using forces, seem inactive, when near must make enemy believe we are far, when we are far we must make enemy believe we are near. Hold out bait to entice enemy, feign disorder, and crush him.
- If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him, if he is in superior strength evade him
- if he is choleric, irritate him, pretend to be weak so that he may grow arrogant. 
- if he is taking ease, give him no rest, if his forces are united, break them.
- Many calculations –> Victory, less calculations –> defeat.
#### Waging War
***
- Thus, even though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been associated with long delays.
- Bring war material from home, but forage on the enemy.
- The men must be roused to anger, thats why they must have their rewards.
- Use the conquered foe to augment one’s own strength.
#### Attack by strategem
- supreme excellence lies in conquering your enemies not destroying them.
- Highest form of general ship is to balk enemy’s plans, then is to prevent the junction of the enemy’s forces, then the next is to attack enemy’s army in field, and the worst is to lay siege on walled cities.
- Rule in war: if our forces are 10:1 surround the enemy, if 5:1 then attack, if twice as numerous, then split the army in half if unequal in any ways then evade the enemy.
Hence, we know that the victory is determined by the following points:
1. When to fight and when not to.
2. How to handle both superior and inferior forces.
3. Whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout the ranks
4. who prepared himself to take the enemy unprepared.
5. who has military capability and is not affected by the sovereign
```
He who knows the enemy and knows himself, need not fear the results of hundred battles. If you know yourself, but not your enemy for every victory you shall suffer defeat. If you know neither enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle
```
