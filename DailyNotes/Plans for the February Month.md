Study Time is from 7 - 10:30 On monday.

Study Plans:
1. We focus on google-sre-book first so that we acquire the entire knowledge and make notes from it.
2. Amazon DynamoDB and Git internals. And after that we focus on LPTH3

Pragmatic Thinking and Thinking Fast and slow, can be taken up in train.
Do we make notes from it? => Yes. We highlight it in kindle, sync it from kindle to laptop and then take notes from it. Or we can take the notes from our phone as well (If we manage to find a seat)

We tried the notes taking method and it seems to be working great for us. We will continue using that very same method

We can also do things this way

greater than 10 points books, we need to take up daily.

between 5-10 on saturday and anything below 5 on sunday evening because we have a bit of freetime for ourselves then.


We also, Don't realize when we had created a document, so as to track that, we would like to start prepending dates in documents and notes whenever we write it
