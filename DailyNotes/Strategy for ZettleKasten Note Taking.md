1. Read or study as we normally would, For super fast scheme of notes taking we are going to go ahead and continue working and devote an hour every eve to make notes out of it.
2. The problem with this scheme is that if we donot do it on one eve, we will end up stuck XD
3. But yes this is the idea. So the KnowledgeRepo is more likely to be a lookup and reference than a on the spot note taking. This will also allow us to initiate a way of working with Filtering of knowledge.

### Office Note taking

1. Write fast down during meetings
    - Convert it into tasks (with bullet points and minute details all the way down to very basic task)
    - Finish the tasks and then find a way to move it into pivotal
    - Take notes properly for the same as well.
    - Make templates for code which we very frequently use.
    - Keep it in `tree`
