22:01 <Aurora_v_kosmose> ³https://genode.org/index ²https://sel4.systems/
22:02 <Aurora_v_kosmose> Unfortunately this is basically all just implementations of a subset of ideas about microkernels & virtualizations, rather than pre-abstracted theory.
22:03 <Aurora_v_kosmose> But basically here's my take on security: ¹https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2008/09/02/three-approaches-to-computer-security.html  I think the author is too optimistic regarding security by correctness.
22:04 <Aeres> I see, got it. WIll save it and then read these too
22:05 <Aurora_v_kosmose> Oh. Genode's foundations book seems to be relatively adequate as a study.
22:06 <Aeres> amazing, time to add that to list as well
22:06 <Aeres> also, how do you study from a book? 
22:06 <Aeres> just sit down and munch on it seems like a wrong way to go at it 
22:07 <Aurora_v_kosmose> Eh... it's basically that. Sit down & think on it.
22:07 <Aurora_v_kosmose> Try to engage with the ideas presented and compare them to what you know & see.
22:07 <Aurora_v_kosmose> Active reading rather than passive reading, if you see what I mean.
22:08 <Aeres> Yes true
