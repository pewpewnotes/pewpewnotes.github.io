I am Aeres, I usually go through lots of things but dont remember most of them,
this notes repository is more like a personal reference book, I maintain it and update it
because it makes me feel like I can retrieve it anytime i want it. 
Ofcourse, its weebfriendly somewhat, some are empty pages or with less content, but I am sure theywill be added soon. 

Pretty Soon i will be adding my blog (assuming I am not lazy enough and I start it someday) till then feel free to access it and use it as your reference as well. If you have copyright issues or anything (idk like people can have copyright over random bits of info all over internet?) feel freeto contact me, you should be able to find out my github username and open a PR. Feel free to fix the tidbits or anything else (yes I have changed this bit XD) 

*Over and out have fun!*
