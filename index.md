### Overview
I'm **Abhishek Upadhayay**, a DevOps Engineer who treats technology the way a scientist treats a strange new organism—poke it, dissect it, map its behavior, and eventually understand it so deeply that building becomes second nature. When I dive into hacking, reverse engineering, or low‑level exploration, I use the pseudonym **KeiTachikawa**, a handle reserved for the corners of the internet where curiosity and precision matter more than introductions.

This page is an honest snapshot of who I am, what drives me, and the kind of work I pour myself into.

### What Defines Me
Curiosity runs my life. I don’t approach subjects like boxes to check—I approach them like worlds to explore. My learning is hands-on, idea-first, and relentlessly iterative.

My intellectual landscape spans:
- **Engineering fundamentals** – I like knowing how systems behave at every layer, from CPU instructions to distributed infrastructure.
- **Science & mathematics** – not just textbook knowledge, but the patterns and rules they reveal about reality.
- **Philosophy & world religions** – I explore them with equal parts skepticism and openness, looking for the universal structures of thought, ethics, and meaning.
- **Creative writing** – I enjoy constructing stories, especially in fantasy settings or where psychology and power dynamics shape the narrative.

If something exists, I want to know how to break it, understand it, fix it, and rebuild it better.

### Hacking, Reverse Engineering & Security
Security fascinates me because it forces a confrontation with truth: either you understand the system or you don’t. I spend time learning how instructions flow, how memory behaves, and how small decisions in code can create massive consequences.

My ongoing goals include:
- Gaining effortless fluency in **assembly**, to the point where it reads like a familiar language.
- Becoming deeply competent in **binary exploitation (pwn)**, not for show, but to engineer more secure systems.
- Strengthening my grasp of **cryptographic primitives** and their safe implementation.
- Developing a sharper intuition for how vulnerabilities form at logical, architectural, and human layers.

Under the identity **KeiTachikawa**, I explore this craft more freely.

### Projects, Practice & Craftsmanship
I build to understand. I break things to understand even more.

My work often revolves around:
- **DevOps engineering** – designing, automating, and managing cloud systems that are reliable and scalable.
- **Tooling & utilities** – writing my own tools to streamline tasks, uncover system behavior, or solve problems elegantly.
- **Golang** – solving structured challenges, experimenting with performance, and becoming sharper at systems programming.
- **Reverse engineering challenges** – analyzing binaries and improving my mental model of compiled code.

I measure progress not by the number of projects I show, but by the capabilities I gain.

### Personal Ethos
I believe in becoming stronger—technically, mentally, physically, and intellectually. For me, growth is multi-dimensional:
- **Physical discipline** – training, staying active, and building resilience.
- **Mental clarity** – reading, reflection, and thinking deeply about how ideas connect.
- **Integrity & openness** – engaging with people across backgrounds, guided by curiosity instead of judgment.

My long-term goal is simple: become someone who can build, reason, and create at a level that stands on its own.

### What People Notice
People often describe me as someone who:
- Learns quickly and isn’t afraid to challenge assumptions.
- Communicates directly and thinks analytically.
- Improves systems rather than just using them.
- Mixes technical depth with philosophical introspection.
- Brings long-term thinking into both engineering and personal growth.

### Closing Note
I’m still evolving, still learning, and still sharpening the tools—both literal and metaphorical—that define my craft. This profile is not a finished story, but a snapshot of my trajectory: a journey shaped by curiosity, discipline, and an appetite for understanding the world at every layer.
