# Binary Reversing tips


pewpew: hellows, I was doign this one https://exploit-exercises.lains.space/protostar/stack1/, its pretty easy but i was thinking if my thought process is correct or
not. Like once I looked at the code i knew that strcpy without checking the strlen will lead to overwrite of next memory place. and went ahead with "random 64
characters"+dcba. So my doubt is that is it possible to know for sure
that modified is after the buffer and i am not modifying some other variable unknowingly? if not then is trial and error all that we do?
Aeres: you can check where the vars are on the stack in the disassembly, e.g. using objdump or gdb
in general, the compiler will put the vars on the stack in inverse order of declaration, meaning the last vars are highest on the stack


pewpew2: objdump gives too much of information, how can i parse it for more info about vars? also, if last are highest on stack meaning I am filling stack from bottom to
up! nice that makes sense
run objdump -d and look at main. you will see that modified sits at -0x4(%ebp) for example, meaning the first declared / lowest on the stack. the buf will be at
-0x64(%ebp)
it takes a bit of practise, but local variables are usually referenced from ebp
sometimes esp
depends on compiler options
but yeah, the level would be more tricky if the order of declaration was reversed and buf was declared before modified
i see pewpew2 :D thanks a lot. this helped.
sure, np :)
